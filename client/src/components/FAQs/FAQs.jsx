          I have accepted a proposal. What is the next step?
          <br />
          After having accepted a proposal, you must make the payment of the
          guarantee deposit in case it is a fixed price job, or if it were a
          project for hours, you must validate your payment method. From this
          you can start working.
          <br />
          To end the work, all that remains is for both to qualify. This
          qualification is confidential, you will only be able to see how the
          chosen professional has qualified you after you have already issued
          your qualification.
